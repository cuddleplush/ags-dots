# My [AGS](https://github.com/Aylur/ags) Setup

> [!WARNING]
> Cursed code<br>
> This setup assumes you use the [hyprsplit](https://github.com/shezdy/hyprsplit) plugin with the default 10 workspaces/monitor, otherwise things will break.
> (It might also work if you *don't* use the plugin but only have 1 monitor, idk)
